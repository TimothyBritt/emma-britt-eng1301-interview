1. What was the worst thing about losing your job during a worldwide pandemic?

    Uncertainty, for sure. When you lose or give up a job under normal economic conditions, there is a baseline confidence that finding the next job will be a reasonable task. When the entire world is shut down indefinitely, it's hard to know how long you will have to ride it out.

2. Were you scared that there wouldn’t be anymore available jobs?

    So, I have been a remote employee in the tech industry for about 15 years at this point, so I think I was very lucky to know that my prospects were somewhat better than most.


3. Did losing your job lead to any mental burdens, like depression or anxiety?

    Yes. Not so much depression, but more anxiety around uncertainty. However, I spent a lot of time and effort building up a large amount of emergency savings, so Gina and I had several years worth of bill payments saved. The anxiety was more around not really wanting to dip into those yet, because of how much work and and time it took to build it.

4. What was the transition like going from working 15 hours a day to being on your own schedule?
   
    All things considered, not being accountable to a meeting or deadline schedule was definitely the nicest part about being unemployed. However, I replaced the work time with study time to prepare myself for bigger and tougher job interviews, because I knew which type of job I eventually wanted to land. It took everyh bit of 6 months for several hours a day to get myself up to speed to pass a big tech interview.

5. Did having your own schedule and taking a break from working change your outlook on your career or lifestyle? 

    Not much. But I was able to step away and focus a lot more on family — and that was a very valuable and enriching learning experience for me. It also helped me to stop identifying with my work and start paying attention to the parts of my life that really matter to me.

6. Did you have any anger towards your past company? 

    Minimal. My previous CEO was under-handed about the way that he went about telling everyone he was out of money and couldn't pay us anymore — but I always trust that everything happens for a reason. If I had allowed anger or frustration to get me down and distract me, there was no way I could have landed my next job. I always try to take the high road and let karma do its own thing.

7. Having partial custody can be stressful sometimes especially when youre in the midst of having lost your job and a pandemic, did you ever worry or stress about seeing us? 

    So, when you are the non-custodial parent, if you are intelligent, you learn to be very patient about spending time with your kids. My utmost concern was safety and peace of mind, so the only real concern was whether your mom felt comfortable with us picking you up, since Gina was still running camp for a little while. But after an honest conversation, we decided it was fine and that we could try to go on as normal as possible. There wasn't much stress around this.

8. Did losing your job change the way you thought about everyday life? 

    Not really. I am more defined by my personal and intellectual endeavors than I am my professional work, so it was really just more of something I had to deal with, similar to other semi-major life events like moving to a new city/home or changing realationships.

9.  Did losing your job change the way you thought about what you wanted at a workplace? 

    No because I am generally a rule-pusher and/or an exception to the general rule. I usually figure out a way to get what I want/need out of my job and workplace. Plus, as a primarily remote worker, I have a lot more control over my enviornment and influences.

10. How did losing your job affect the way you thought about your career and workplace?

    Same as above.

11. How long did you wait to start looking for a new job? 

    Well, I started looking immediately, as that is a stipulation of unemployment claims — and I was interested in the job market. But I did not take the search seriously for several months until I was able to figure out what was out there.

12. Why did you wait that long? 

    I wanted to get a sense for the type of companies that were hiring and how they were able to hire so aggressively in an economic downturn.

13. Did you have to go back to school or get extra training? 

    The general type of job I was aiming for usually requires a good understanding and knowledge of basic computer science fundamentals — the kind of thing you pick up in a CS degree in college. Since I didn't have that background, I had to teach myself the equivalent in about 6 months. It worked, because I ended up crushing my interviews and got the job.

14. What did you look for in your job search? 

    Responsibility and opportunity. I think most people focus too much on money, and I think they should be looking for learning experiences rather than just another way to pay bills.

15. Was is hard to get a new job during a worldwide pandemic? 

    The market was definitely more competitive. But since I have a specific skillset that is generally in high-demand, and a knack for communication, getting interviews and offers was not particularly difficult for me as it might have been for others.

16. What was your biggest challenge in the search of a new job? 

    Not knowing exactly how to interview for big tech companies!

17. Do you still keep in contact with your past co-workers? 

    Yes, but only certain ones that had nothing to do with shady business practices.

18. Was it difficult losing those relationships and bonds? 

    No. Once you realize who someone really is, it should be very easy to simply see your life as better without them in it.

19. What is the biggest positive about coming out of your job? 

    Since I was working on startups, I was in director and executive positions with a high degree of responsibility and exposure. Also, since I was part of smaller organizations, I got to wear many hats and learn about areas of tech systems that I didn't have exposure to before. This directly helped me get a new, better job.

20.  Is there anything else you would like to tell me about before we wrap up?

    There is always a silver lining to every situation, without exception. You just have to look for it.
